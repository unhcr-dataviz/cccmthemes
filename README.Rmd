Simplify the creation of your data visualizations with the `{cccmthemes}` R package. It is designed to align your plots with [CCCM's Design Guide](https://www.cccmcluster.org/branding-collection) recommendations. This package offers a comprehensive `{ggplot2}` theme, including built-in customizations and thoughtfully crafted color palettes.

## Installation

Get started by installing the `{cccmthemes}` package from GitHub using the `{pak}` library:

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
# If pak is not yet installed, uncomment the following line:
# install.packages("pak")

pak::pkg_install("unhcr-dataviz/cccmthemes")
```

## Usage

```{r load, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Load required packages
library(ggplot2)
library(cccmthemes)
```

### Base `{ggplot2}` theme

```{r base-plot, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align="center"}
# Apply the theme_unhcr() to your plot
ggplot(
  mtcars,
  aes(x = hp, y = mpg)
) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Simple scatterplot with ggplot",
    subtitle = "This plot shows the default style of theme_cccm()",
    x = "Horsepower (hp)",
    y = "Fuel efficiency (mpg)",
    caption = "Source: mtcars"
  ) +
  theme_cccm()
```

### Font

The officially recommended font is [`Inter`](https://github.com/rsms/inter). To ensure optimal functionality of the `{cccmthemes}` package, please make sure that the `Inter` font is installed on your device prior to usage.
